# Custom Losses (Client-Side)

This guide documents **client-defined training objectives** on TuFT via the Tinker SDK's
`forward_backward_custom` — for example a composite objective that mixes **DPO** with a weighted
**NLL** anchor. The workflow is **officially supported on both training backends** (`hf` and
`fsdp`) with an **unmodified TuFT server**: your loss stays a plain PyTorch function in *your*
process, and the server only ever executes its built-in, allowlisted loss functions.

```python
def my_loss(data: list[types.Datum], logprobs_list: list[torch.Tensor]):
    loss = ...  # any differentiable torch scalar over logprobs_list
    return loss, {"my_metric:sum": loss.item()}


training_client.forward_backward_custom(data, my_loss, loss_type_input="logprobs")
```

## When to Use a Custom Loss

TuFT ships five server-side loss functions — `cross_entropy`, `importance_sampling`, `ppo`,
`cispo`, and `dro` — selected by name in `forward_backward(data, loss_fn=...)`. The server
**allowlists these names at the wire protocol** and rejects anything else, so tenants can never
run arbitrary code on shared infrastructure.

Reach for `forward_backward_custom` when your objective is a differentiable function of the
**per-token target log-probabilities** but is not one of those five. Typical cases:

- **Preference objectives** (DPO and variants) that couple *pairs* of datums through one scalar.
- **Composite objectives**, e.g. DPO plus a weighted NLL anchor, or policy/reference
  log-ratio regularizers.
- Quick research iterations on bespoke losses without touching (or forking) the server.

If your objective *is* one of the built-ins, prefer `forward_backward`: it costs one fewer
forward pass per step ([details below](#performance-costs)).

```{admonition} Requires
:class: note

`tinker` ≥ 0.25 (the SDK version TuFT pins) and `torch` installed **on the client**. The custom
callback runs in your process only — the TuFT server never imports or executes client Python,
and no new server-side loss names are introduced.
```

## How It Works: Two-Pass Semantics

`forward_backward_custom(data, loss_fn, loss_type_input="logprobs")` is client-side sugar. The
SDK lowers it onto **two ordinary requests** that any TuFT server already serves:

```text
 client                                             TuFT server
 ──────                                             ───────────
 1. forward(data, loss_fn="cross_entropy")   ──►    forward pass only (no_grad)
    ◄──  loss_fn_outputs[i]["logprobs"]             per-datum target log-probs

 2. loss, metrics = loss_fn(data, logprobs)         (your PyTorch code, local autograd)
    grads[i] = ∂loss/∂logprobs[i]

 3. forward_backward(data', "cross_entropy") ──►    forward + backward, accumulates grads
       with weights[i] = -grads[i]
    ◄──  ForwardBackwardOutput (+ your metrics merged in by the SDK)
```

The trick in step 3: the server's cross-entropy is the **linear** form
`L = -(target_logprobs * weights).sum()`, so `∂L/∂logprobs = -weights = ∂loss/∂logprobs`. By
the chain rule the backward pass accumulates **exactly** `∂loss/∂θ` — the same gradients you
would get differentiating your composite loss straight through the model. TuFT's test suite
pins this equivalence on both backends (`tests/test_custom_loss.py`), including that a custom
weighted-NLL callback reproduces the built-in `cross_entropy` gradients to numerical precision.

Because both passes evaluate the *current* weights, the log-probs your callback sees are exact,
not stale: the SDK submits the two requests back-to-back with consecutive sequence IDs and TuFT
executes each training run's requests strictly in order.

## Minimal Example: SFT as a Custom Loss

Runs against any TuFT server (HF or FSDP backend) — start one as in the
[Quickstart](../getting-started/quickstart.md), then:

```python
import tinker
import torch
from tinker import types

service_client = tinker.ServiceClient(base_url="http://localhost:10610", api_key="local-dev-key")
base_model = service_client.get_server_capabilities().supported_models[0].model_name
training_client = service_client.create_lora_training_client(base_model=base_model, rank=8)
tokenizer = training_client.get_tokenizer()


def make_datum(prompt: str, completion: str) -> types.Datum:
    prompt_tokens = tokenizer.encode(prompt, add_special_tokens=True)
    completion_tokens = tokenizer.encode(completion, add_special_tokens=False)
    tokens = prompt_tokens + completion_tokens
    # Standard next-token setup: model_input = tokens[:-1], target_tokens = tokens[1:],
    # and weights masking the prompt so only completion tokens are supervised.
    weights = [0.0] * (len(prompt_tokens) - 1) + [1.0] * len(completion_tokens)
    return types.Datum(
        model_input=types.ModelInput.from_ints(tokens[:-1]),
        loss_fn_inputs={
            "target_tokens": types.TensorData(data=tokens[1:], dtype="int64"),
            "weights": types.TensorData(data=weights, dtype="float32"),
        },
    )


data = [
    make_datum("English: hello world\nPig Latin:", " ello-hay orld-way\n"),
    make_datum("English: banana split\nPig Latin:", " anana-bay plit-say\n"),
]


def sft_loss(data: list[types.Datum], logprobs_list: list[torch.Tensor]):
    """Weighted NLL — the client-side twin of the built-in cross_entropy."""
    loss = torch.zeros(())
    for datum, logprobs in zip(data, logprobs_list, strict=True):
        weights = datum.loss_fn_inputs["weights"].to_torch()
        loss = loss - (logprobs * weights).sum()
    return loss, {"sft_nll:sum": loss.item()}


for _ in range(10):
    result = training_client.forward_backward_custom(data, sft_loss).result()
    training_client.optim_step(types.AdamParams(learning_rate=1e-4)).result()
    print(result.metrics["sft_nll:sum"])
```

The callback receives one `logprobs_list[i]` per `data[i]`, **in order**, each a 1-D float32
tensor of length `len(data[i].model_input)` — `logprobs_list[i][t]` is the log-probability the
current model assigns to `target_tokens[t]` at position `t`. Your metrics dictionary is merged
into the returned `result.metrics` alongside the server's metrics for the surrogate loss.

## Composite Example: DPO + NLL

A cross-example objective no per-datum server loss could express: datums arrive as
(chosen, rejected) pairs sharing a prompt, and the loss couples each pair through one sigmoid
plus a small NLL anchor on the chosen completion.

```python
import torch.nn.functional as F

# data = [chosen_0, rejected_0, chosen_1, rejected_1, ...], built with make_datum
# where weights mask the shared prompt (0.0) and cover the completion (1.0).
BETA = 0.5
NLL_COEF = 0.05


def dpo_composite_loss(data: list[types.Datum], logprobs_list: list[torch.Tensor]):
    completion_sums = [
        (logprobs * datum.loss_fn_inputs["weights"].to_torch()).sum()
        for datum, logprobs in zip(data, logprobs_list, strict=True)
    ]
    dpo = torch.zeros(())
    nll = torch.zeros(())
    for i in range(0, len(completion_sums), 2):
        chosen, rejected = completion_sums[i], completion_sums[i + 1]
        dpo = dpo - F.logsigmoid(BETA * (chosen - rejected))
        nll = nll - chosen / len(data)
    loss = dpo + NLL_COEF * nll
    return loss, {"dpo:sum": dpo.item(), "composite:sum": loss.item()}


result = training_client.forward_backward_custom(data, dpo_composite_loss).result()
training_client.optim_step(types.AdamParams(learning_rate=1e-4)).result()
```

Need a frozen **reference policy** term (as in standard DPO)? Score the same datums once with a
separate, untrained client — e.g. `service_client.create_sampling_client(base_model=...)` and
`compute_logprobs`, as in the [On-Policy Distillation guide](on-policy-distillation.md) — and
close over those constant reference log-probs inside your callback.

## Supported Inputs

`loss_type_input="logprobs"` is the only supported input space (and the default). Per datum,
`loss_fn_inputs` may contain **exactly**:

| Key | Required | Dtype | Constraint |
|---|---|---|---|
| `target_tokens` | yes | `int64` | same length as `model_input` |
| `weights` | no | `float32` | same length as `target_tokens` |

The SDK **rejects any other key client-side** (e.g. `advantages`) before a request is sent.
`weights` serve two roles: your callback can read them back (e.g. as a prompt mask, as above),
and the server uses them for the pass-1 surrogate loss metric. When omitted, the SDK sends
zeros for pass 1; pass 2 always overwrites them with the gradient-derived values.

Your callback must return a tuple of a **scalar torch tensor** (differentiable w.r.t. the
log-prob tensors) and a **`dict[str, float]`** of metrics. Name metrics `"name:reduction"`
(e.g. `:sum`, `:mean`) to match the Tinker convention.

## Performance Costs

- **~1.5× compute per step.** Each `forward_backward_custom` costs *two* forward passes plus
  one backward (versus one forward + one backward for a built-in loss), and one extra
  round-trip shipping log-probs to the client and weights back.
- **No hidden activation memory.** Pass 1 runs under `torch.no_grad()` on both backends, so it
  allocates no autograd graph; peak memory is set by the backward pass, same as built-in
  losses.
- **Payload size.** Weights are dense float32 per token; for very large batches the SDK
  automatically chunks requests, and TuFT preserves datum order within and across chunks.
- **FSDP multi-GPU.** Both passes shard the batch across ranks, so each of the two requests
  must satisfy `len(data) >= fsdp_num_gpus` — the same constraint as `forward_backward`.

## Error Handling

- **Unknown loss names never reach a model.** `/forward_backward` validates `loss_fn` against
  the built-in allowlist at protobuf decode time and answers **422**; `forward_backward_custom`
  needs no new names, so unmodified servers accept it.
- **Malformed datum inputs** (a key missing on some datum, mismatched shapes/dtypes) are
  rejected with **400/409** and a `loss_fn_inputs`-specific detail; on the HF backend,
  `target_tokens` and `weights` must match the model-input length exactly.
- **Callback exceptions stay client-side.** If your loss function raises (or an input datum
  carries an unsupported key), the error surfaces in your process. When this happens between
  the two passes, no harm is done server-side: pass 1 accumulated nothing, so the training
  run's gradient state is unchanged and you can simply retry.

## Model-State Invariants

- **Pass 1 is a pure read.** It changes no weights and accumulates no gradients (pinned by
  tests on both backends). A crashed or abandoned custom step leaves the run exactly as it was.
- **Pass 2 behaves like any `forward_backward`.** Gradients accumulate until the next
  `optim_step`, so you can mix custom and built-in objectives in one accumulation window (e.g.
  sum DPO and RL gradients before a single optimizer step).
- **Don't slip an `optim_step` between the passes.** The SDK orders the two requests on
  consecutive sequence IDs, and TuFT executes each run's requests in order — but if another
  thread enqueues an `optim_step` between pass 1's completion and pass 2's submission, pass 2
  would apply gradients computed against pre-step log-probs. Sequential usage (await the
  returned future, then call `optim_step`) is always safe.
- **Custom code never runs server-side.** Multi-tenant deployments keep their security
  boundary: the server executes only its five built-in loss functions.

## Q&A

**Q: Which SDK versions work?**
`forward_backward_custom` with `loss_type_input="logprobs"` is validated against the Tinker SDK
release TuFT pins (0.25.x, see `pyproject.toml`). The mechanism relies only on the stable
`forward` / `forward_backward` wire contract.

**Q: Can I use inputs other than log-probs (e.g. full logits)?**
Not currently — `"logprobs"` is the only `loss_type_input` the SDK offers, and TuFT returns
per-token *target* log-probs only. Losses needing full-vocabulary distributions (e.g. exact KL
to a teacher) can often be re-expressed against sampled targets; see the
[On-Policy Distillation guide](on-policy-distillation.md) for that pattern.

**Q: Do custom metrics aggregate across micro-batches?**
Your callback sees the *whole* request at once (the server's micro-batching is invisible to
it), computes metrics once, and the SDK merges them into the final result — no server-side
reduction is applied to them.

**Q: How do I debug a suspicious gradient?**
Compare against the direct computation: run your callback's math straight through a local copy
of the model (or against `training_client.forward(...)` log-probs) and check the loss values
match. `tests/test_custom_loss.py` shows the pattern used to validate TuFT itself.
